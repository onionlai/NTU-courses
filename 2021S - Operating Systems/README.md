# 2021 Spring | Operating Systems
Here are machine problems (mp) I did in Operating System (OS) course. All mps are built on _xv6_, a simple OS kernel created by MIT for pedagogical purpose, and we use Docker to create the environment to run them. All docker images and codes were forked from TAs.

### MP0 - Set up xv6
### MP1 - Thread Package
### MP2 - Shared Memory
### MP3 - Scheduling
### MP4 - File System
