# 2021 Fall | Digital Sound Art and Creation
In this course, we used PureData, an open source visual programming language for multimedia, to make our own multimedia works. Although it is not a typical CS course, I want to share all the funny work I've done with my teammates in this course.

## Project 1 - Sound of 13-Face Bricks
The 13-groove bricks, which are commonly seen in the buildings of National Taiwan University, are a building material that became popular in Taiwan at the end of 1920. It was mainly produced by the Beitou Kiln Factory and was used in many public buildings built during that period. The 13-groove bricks are also called national defense bricks. Because the concave-convex design on the surface can avoid reflection, those bricks and can protect the building from being discovered by the enemy. In Taiwan's rainy climate, these grooves also help draining the water on the surface of the building.

In this project, we took pictures of thirteen-groove bricks of different buildings on campus. Since the orientation of the buildings are all different, they have different color, different erosion level and different shadows. We perform some image processing such as discrete cosine transform to systematically extract features of different bricks, and then use those features to create _sound of 13-groove bricks_ in PureData. Finally, we remix school song with _sound of 13-groove bricks_ and make a simple pygame playground for user to interact with bricks and create different sound.

## Project 2 - Popcorn NFT
In this project, we make an ASMR interactive NFT work using p5.js and PureData. Users can pop the popcorn by clicking on corn seeds, or turn on the fire by hitting space to let them randomly pop off and enjoy the ASMR sound.
